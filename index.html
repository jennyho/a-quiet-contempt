<!-- conclusion -->
<!--<div class="container">
    <p class="explain conclusion"> Not only does social stigma disincentivize individuals from seeking help, but its pervasiveness also has a more insidiuous impact. In addition to the general public, stigma affects health providers and policymakers, contributing to structural barriers that make getting treatment difficult. </p>
